# Stripe Integration Status

## ✅ What's Ready
- Stripe payment infrastructure code is in place
- API routes for checkout and webhooks are created
- Frontend integration hooks are ready
- Dashboard UI has upgrade buttons (currently shows alert)
- Database schema supports Stripe fields

## 🎯 Current Setup (Basic)
The app currently shows upgrade buttons that display an alert message directing users to set up Stripe.

## 📋 Quick Setup (5 minutes)
1. **Create Stripe account** at https://stripe.com
2. **Get API keys** from Dashboard → Developers → API keys
3. **Create a product** in Dashboard → Products ($5.99/month)
4. **Add to .env.local**:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_MONTHLY_USD=price_your_price_id_here
   ```

## 🚀 To Complete Integration Later
1. Uncomment Stripe imports in `dashboard/page.tsx`
2. Replace alert with actual `createCheckoutSession(user.id)`
3. Set up webhooks for subscription events
4. Test with Stripe test cards

## 📁 Files Ready for Implementation
- `/src/app/api/stripe/create-checkout/route.ts`
- `/src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`
- `/src/hooks/useStripeCheckout.ts`
- `/src/lib/stripe/config.ts`

All the heavy lifting is done - just need to uncomment a few lines when ready!
