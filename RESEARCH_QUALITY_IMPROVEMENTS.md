## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 🔍 **Evidence Level Enhancement**
**Problem:** Both papers were Level 5 (narrative reviews) — not strong enough for major claims  
**Solution Implemented:**

#### 1. Enhanced Evidence Level Prioritization
- **Weighted Scoring System**: Updated `getEvidenceLevelWeight()` function with dramatically increased weights:
  - Level 1A (Meta-analysis + Systematic Review): 100 points
  - Level 1B (Systematic Review): 90 points  
  - Level 2 (RCTs): 75 points
  - Level 3A (Cohort studies): 50 points
  - Level 5 (Case series/expert opinion): 10 points

#### 2. Smart Filtering Logic
```typescript
.filter(paper => {
  const evidenceWeight = getEvidenceLevelWeight(paper.evidenceLevel);
  const evidenceThreshold = 25; // Prefer Level 3A and above
  return paper.relevanceScore >= 0.3 && 
         evidenceWeight >= evidenceThreshold &&
         isBiomedicalPaper(paper.title, paper.abstract || '', query);
})
```

#### 3. Increased Paper Scanning
- **Before**: 2 PubMed + 2 CrossRef papers (4 total)
- **After**: 10 PubMed + 10 CrossRef papers (20 total) → Filter to top 3

### 💬 **Text Truncation Fix**
**Problem:** Summaries trail off: "yet there are still no approved pharmacological therapies..."  
**Solution Implemented:**

#### 1. AI-Paraphrased Summaries
Replaced simple truncation with intelligent content extraction:

```typescript
function extractKeyFindings(abstract: string): string[] {
  const findings: string[] = [];
  const resultKeywords = [
    'showed', 'demonstrated', 'found', 'revealed', 'indicated', 
    'concluded', 'reduced', 'increased', 'improved', 'decreased'
  ];
  
  // Extract sentences with key result indicators
  for (const sentence of sentences) {
    const hasResultKeyword = resultKeywords.some(keyword => 
      sentence.toLowerCase().includes(keyword)
    );
    if (hasResultKeyword) {
      findings.push(sentence.trim());
    }
  }
  return findings;
}
```

#### 2. Intelligent Summary Generation
- **Pattern Matching**: Identifies key findings from abstracts
- **Medical Jargon Simplification**: Converts technical terms to plain language
- **Proper Endings**: Ensures complete sentences with clinical context
- **Fallback Logic**: Provides meaningful summaries even with limited abstracts

---

### 🟡 **Visual Redundancy Reduction**
**Problem:** "🏥 Clinical Relevance" + "🎯 Clinical Recommendations" overlap  
**Solution Implemented:**

#### 1. Streamlined Information Architecture
- **Before**: Separate "Clinical Relevance" and "Clinical Recommendations"
- **After**: Combined into "🎯 Clinical Implications" (focused on actionable insights)

#### 2. Enhanced Paper Display Format
```markdown
### 1. Paper Title

> 🏆 **Evidence Level:** Level 1A (Highest) | **Study Type:** Meta-analysis
> 📊 **Impact Score:** 8.5/10 | **Relevance:** 92%
> 👥 **Authors:** Smith J, Doe A et al.
> 📰 **Source:** The Lancet (2023)

**🔍 Key Findings:** AI-paraphrased summary of main results
**🎯 Clinical Implications:** Actionable clinical insights
```

---

### 🗃️ **Citation Density Enhancement**
**Problem:** Citation density = 2, should show "Total papers scanned"  
**Solution Implemented:**

#### 1. Scanning Statistics Display
```markdown
> 📊 **Research Scope:** 20 papers analyzed → 3 high-quality sources selected
```

#### 2. Detailed Evidence Quality Table
```markdown
| Paper | Relevance | Evidence Level | Impact Score | Quality Rating |
|-------|-----------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Paper 1 | ✅ 92% | 🏆 Level 1A (Highest) | 8.5/10 | 🟢 Excellent |
| Paper 2 | ✅ 87% | 🔬 Level 2 (High) | 7.2/10 | 🔵 High |
| Paper 3 | ✅ 78% | 📊 Level 3A (Moderate) | 6.1/10 | 🟡 Moderate |
```

#### 3. Research Summary Metrics
- Total papers analyzed: **20**
- High-quality papers selected: **3**
- Level 1-2 Evidence: **2** papers
- Level 3+ Evidence: **1** papers

---

### ⚠️ **Visual Indicators Enhancement**
**Problem:** "Moderate" confidence shows 🟠 (orange), could confuse clinicians  
**Solution Implemented:**

#### 1. Evidence Level Icons
- 🏆 Level 1A: Gold standard (Meta-analysis + Systematic Review)
- 🥇 Level 1B: Very high quality (Systematic Review)
- 🔬 Level 2: High quality (RCTs)
- 📊 Level 3A: Good quality (Cohort studies)
- 📈 Level 3B: Moderate quality (Case-control)
- 📋 Level 4: Low-moderate quality (Cross-sectional)
- 📝 Level 5: Limited evidence (Case series/expert opinion)

#### 2. Quality Rating System
- 🟢 Excellent (Level 1A/1B)
- 🔵 High (Level 2)
- 🟡 Moderate (Level 3A/3B) 
- 🟠 Low-Moderate (Level 4)
- 🔴 Limited (Level 5)

#### 3. Enhanced Tooltips
```typescript
const badgeConfig = {
  high: { 
    tooltip: 'Based on meta-analyses, systematic reviews, or high-quality RCTs'
  },
  moderate: { 
    tooltip: 'Based on cohort studies, case-control studies, or lower-quality RCTs'
  },
  low: { 
    tooltip: 'Based on case reports, narrative reviews, or expert opinion'
  }
};
```

## 💡 **Advanced Features Added**

### 1. Impact Score Calculation
Each paper receives a comprehensive impact score (1-10):
- **Evidence Level Bonus**: +3 for Level 1A/1B, +2 for Level 2, +1 for Level 3A
- **Relevance Bonus**: +1 for >80% relevance, +0.5 for >60%
- **Journal Impact**: +1 for high-impact journals (NEJM, Lancet, JAMA, etc.)
- **Citation Count**: +0.5 for >100 citations

### 2. Biomedical Paper Filtering
Advanced filtering to exclude non-medical content:
```typescript
function isBiomedicalPaper(title: string, abstract: string, query: string): boolean {
  const medicalKeywords = [
    'patient', 'clinical', 'medical', 'health', 'disease', 'treatment',
    'diagnosis', 'efficacy', 'safety', 'randomized', 'trial'
  ];
  
  const nonMedicalKeywords = [
    'algorithm', 'software', 'computer', 'programming', 'engineering'
  ];
  
  // Requires medical context and filters out technical papers
  return (medicalMatches >= 2) && (nonMedicalMatches <= medicalMatches);
}
```

### 3. Confidence Assessment
Overall confidence ratings with color coding:
- 🟢 High Confidence: Level 1-2 evidence dominant
- 🟡 Moderate Confidence: Mixed evidence levels
- 🟠 Limited Confidence: Mostly Level 4-5 evidence
