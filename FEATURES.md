## How It Works

### Query Processing
1. User submits a medical question or document
2. System analyzes input and determines appropriate mode
3. Relevant databases are queried in parallel
4. Results are processed and synthesized
5. Response is generated with proper citations

### Security Flow
1. User authenticates via Supabase Auth
2. All requests are encrypted with TLS 1.3
3. Sensitive operations require re-authentication
4. All data access is logged and monitored

### Research Workflow
1. Query is analyzed and optimized
2. Multiple databases are searched simultaneously
3. Results are ranked by relevance and quality
4. Sources are validated and cross-referenced
5. Final response is generated with proper citations
