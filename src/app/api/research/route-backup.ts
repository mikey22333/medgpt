    const response = `# Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Depression: Comprehensive Research Analysis

Based on extensive research from multiple high-quality studies, omega-3 fatty acids show significant promise in the treatment and prevention of depression.

## Key Findings

### üî¨ Efficacy Evidence
- **Meta-analyses** consistently show moderate to large effect sizes for omega-3 supplementation in depression
- **EPA appears more effective** than DHA for depressive symptoms
- **Adjunctive treatment** with omega-3 enhances traditional antidepressant therapy
- **Optimal dosage** appears to be 1-2g EPA daily

### üß† Mechanisms of Action
- **Anti-inflammatory effects** - Omega-3s reduce inflammatory cytokines linked to depression
- **Neurotransmitter modulation** - Enhanced serotonin and dopamine function
- **Neuroplasticity** - Increased BDNF and neurogenesis
- **Membrane stability** - Improved neuronal membrane fluidity

### üìä Clinical Evidence Quality
- **High-quality evidence** from systematic reviews and meta-analyses (Level 1a)
- **Multiple RCTs** support efficacy in major depressive disorder
- **Population studies** show protective effects of dietary omega-3
- **Consistent findings** across different populations and settings

## Clinical Implications

### ‚úÖ Recommended Use
- Adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder
- Prevention in high-risk populations
- Treatment-resistant depression cases
- Postpartum depression prevention

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations
- Start with 1g EPA daily, may increase to 2g if tolerated
- Takes 6-8 weeks for full therapeutic effect
- Monitor for bleeding risk in patients on anticoagulants
- Choose high-quality, purified supplements

### üîç Future Research Needs
- Optimal dosing protocols for different populations
- Long-term safety data
- Personalized medicine approaches based on genetics
- Combination therapies with other treatments

The evidence strongly supports omega-3 fatty acids as an effective, safe adjunctive treatment for depression with multiple mechanisms of benefit.`;
