## When PubMed Doesn't Have What You Need 🔍

### **Scenarios Where Other APIs Are Essential:**

#### 1. **Very Recent Research** (last 6 months)
- **Problem**: PubMed has indexing delays
- **Solution**: Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex for preprints and early publications
- **Example**: "Latest COVID-19 variant treatments" - may need preprint servers

#### 2. **Non-Medical Scientific Fields**
- **Problem**: PubMed focuses on biomedical literature
- **Solution**: OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar for broader scientific coverage
- **Example**: "Environmental toxicology" or "bioengineering research"

#### 3. **Industry/Commercial Research**
- **Problem**: PubMed doesn't index industry white papers
- **Solution**: FDA database for drug approvals, industry reports
- **Example**: "FDA drug approval data" or "pharmaceutical pipeline"

#### 4. **International Research**
- **Problem**: PubMed has English/US bias
- **Solution**: Europe PMC for European research
- **Example**: "European clinical guidelines" or "non-English studies"

#### 5. **Clinical Trial Details**
- **Problem**: PubMed has published results, not trial protocols
- **Solution**: ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing/planned studies
- **Example**: "Active trials for rare diseases"

#### 6. **Practice Guidelines**
- **Problem**: PubMed has research papers, not clinical guidelines
- **Solution**: Clinical Guidelines API for professional recommendations
- **Example**: "NICE guidelines" or "AHA treatment protocols"

#### 7. **Research Funding Context**
- **Problem**: PubMed doesn't show funding sources/amounts
- **Solution**: NIH RePORTER for grant information
- **Example**: "NIH investment in cancer research"

### **Current Fallback Strategy** ⚠️

**Issue**: Other APIs are integrated but not returning results due to:
- Missing API keys
- Rate limiting issues  
- Implementation bugs

**Immediate Solutions**:
1. **Fix API keys** for Semantic Scholar, Cochrane, etc.
2. **Implement graceful fallbacks** when PubMed is insufficient
3. **Add search diversity detection** to automatically use other APIs

**Current Status**:
- ✅ **PubMed**: Fully operational - returning 3 high-quality articles per query with PMIDs
- ✅ **Enhanced Search**: Simplified query builder working correctly for reliable results  
- ✅ **Modern Treatments**: Including CGRP receptor antagonists (rimegepant, etc.)
- ✅ **GRADE Scoring**: Evidence quality assessment working for PubMed results
- ✅ **Citation Links**: Direct PMID and DOI links functional
- ⚠️ **Other APIs**: Integrated but may need API keys/debugging for full functionality

**Quality Metrics Achieved**:
- High-quality medical literature from PubMed (primary source)
- Recent studies (2014-2024) with human subjects
- Modern treatment coverage (CGRP, gepants, etc.)
- Professional medical consensus statements
- Direct PMID access to full abstracts

PubMed as the primary medical database is now working reliably and providing comprehensive, evidence-based research results.
