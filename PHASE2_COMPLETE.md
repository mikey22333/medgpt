## ðŸŽ¯ Key Capabilities Added

1. **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Each AI response now includes detailed reasoning steps showing the thought process
2. **Evidence Quality Assessment**: Automatic evaluation of research quality and evidence levels
3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Clear identification of limitations and areas of uncertainty
4. **Critical Questions**: Proactive identification of important questions to consider
5. **Confidence Indicators**: Visual confidence scoring for each reasoning step
6. **Interactive Transparency**: Users can expand/collapse reasoning details

## ðŸš€ Ready for Phase 3

The foundation is now in place for Phase 3 enhancements:
- Multi-agent reasoning systems
- Advanced bias detection
- Confidence calibration
- Real-time reasoning updates
- Interactive intelligence features

## ðŸ”§ Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the application
3. Toggle "Deep Intelligence ON/OFF" button
4. Ask any medical question in Research or Doctor mode
5. Observe the reasoning steps displayed above AI responses
6. Expand/collapse different reasoning steps to see details

The system now provides transparent, step-by-step reasoning for medical queries with enhanced intelligence across all three modes.
