# Clinical Summary Extraction & Rendering Test

## Expected Behavior

When a message contains clinical summary content like:
```
📋 Clinical Summary (TL;DR) • 🎯 Primary Cause: Anticoagulation therapy... • 🔬 Secondary Causes: ... • 🩺 Diagnostic Tools: ... • ⚠️ Evidence Gaps: ...

🧬 Evidence Sources and Study Types
```

## Expected Results

### ✅ Clinical Summary Should:
1. **Be extracted** from main content and displayed in its own section
2. **Display as separate cards** - one for each section (Primary Cause, Secondary Causes, etc.)
3. **NOT appear** in the main message content area
4. **Have proper visual formatting** with icons, titles, and styled confidence badges

### ✅ Main Content Should:
1. **NOT contain** the clinical summary text
2. **Only show** the research answer content without the clinical summary
3. **Be clean** without clinical summary duplication

## Test Steps

1. **Open browser dev tools** and check console for debug messages:
   - Look for: "Successfully extracted clinical summary: ..."
   - Look for: "Found clinical summary: ..."

2. **Check visual layout**:
   - Clinical summary should appear as individual cards below the main content
   - Each card should have an icon (🎯, 🔬, 🩺, ⚠️) and title
   - Main content should NOT contain the clinical summary text

3. **Verify sections**:
   - Primary Cause card with 🎯 icon
   - Secondary Causes card with 🔬 icon  
   - Diagnostic Tools card with 🩺 icon
   - Evidence Gaps card with ⚠️ icon

## Debug Information

If clinical summary is still appearing as a paragraph:

1. **Check console logs** for extraction messages
2. **Verify content parsing** - the clinical summary should be extracted before rendering
3. **Check main content cleaning** - clinical summary text should be removed from main content

## Technical Details

- **Extraction method**: Substring-based approach using TL;DR and Evidence Sources markers
- **Fallback**: Regex patterns if substring approach fails
- **Rendering**: Each section gets its own white card with proper spacing
- **Content cleaning**: Clinical summary is removed from main content to prevent duplication

---

**Current Status**: Testing in progress - clinical summary should now display as properly formatted section cards instead of paragraph text.
