## 🎓 **Patient Education Features by Condition**

### **Stroke Education** (Complete Implementation)
```
📋 Simple Explanation:
"A stroke happens when blood flow to part of your brain stops. This can damage 
brain cells. There are two main types: one caused by a blocked blood vessel 
(most common) and one caused by bleeding in the brain."

💡 Key Points (6th Grade Level):
• Strokes are medical emergencies - get help right away
• Many strokes can be prevented with healthy lifestyle choices  
• Taking medications as prescribed is very important
• Recovery is possible with proper treatment and rehabilitation

🏃 Lifestyle Changes:
• Quit smoking if you smoke
• Exercise regularly (ask your doctor what's safe for you)
• Eat a healthy diet with lots of fruits and vegetables
• Take your blood pressure medications every day
• Control your blood sugar if you have diabetes

⚠️ Warning Signs (FAST Method):
• Face drooping on one side
• Arm weakness (can't lift both arms equally)
• Speech problems (slurred or confused words)
• Time to call 911 immediately

🚨 Call Doctor Right Away:
• Any signs of stroke (call 911 immediately)
• Sudden severe headache that's different from usual
• Sudden trouble speaking or understanding

💊 Blood Thinner Education:
Name: Blood Thinners (like warfarin, apixaban)
Purpose: These medications help prevent blood clots that could cause another stroke
Side Effects: Easy bruising, bleeding that takes longer to stop
Important: Take exactly as prescribed - never skip doses
```

### **Heart Disease Education** (Auto-Generated)
```
📋 Simple Explanation:
"Heart disease happens when your heart muscle doesn't get enough blood, usually 
because the blood vessels to your heart are narrowed or blocked."

💡 Key Points:
• Heart disease is the leading cause of death but often preventable
• Chest pain is the most common symptom but not the only one
• Many treatments can help your heart work better
• Lifestyle changes are as important as medications

🏃 Lifestyle Changes:
• Stop smoking completely
• Exercise most days of the week
• Eat heart-healthy foods (less salt, more vegetables)
• Maintain a healthy weight
• Manage stress with relaxation techniques

⚠️ Warning Signs:
• Chest pain or pressure
• Shortness of breath
• Pain in arm, neck, or jaw
• Unusual fatigue
• Swelling in legs or feet
